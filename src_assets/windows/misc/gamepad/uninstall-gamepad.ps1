<#
    Uninstall ViGEm Bus driver using pnputil.
    Previous implementation queried Win32_Product which only lists MSI packages and
    wonâ€™t find the PnP driver installed by the ViGEmBus installer, so it did nothing.

    This script enumerates installed driver packages, finds any with Original Name
    matching ViGEmBus.inf, and deletes them with /uninstall /force.
